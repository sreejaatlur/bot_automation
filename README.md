# Automated Course Registration System

Welcome to the Automated Course Registration System project! This system automates the process of course registration by providing notifications when open seats become available for desired courses.

## Overview

The Automated Course Registration System is designed to streamline the course registration process by continuously monitoring course availability and sending notifications to users when seats become available for their desired courses. It aims to alleviate the frustration of missing out on course registrations due to limited seat availability.

1. Set up an AWS EC2 instance to host the application.
2. Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.
3. Install tmux to run the application in the background.
4. Upload project files to the EC2 instance using a tool like WinSCP.

### Usage
